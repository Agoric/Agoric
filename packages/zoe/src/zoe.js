/**
 * @typedef {Object} ZoeService
 * Zoe provides a framework for deploying and working with smart contracts. It
 * is accessed as a long-lived and well-trusted service that enforces offer
 * safety for the contracts that use it. Zoe has a single `inviteIssuer` for
 * the entirety of its lifetime. By having a reference to Zoe, a user can get
 * the `inviteIssuer` and thus validate any `invite` they receive from someone
 * else.
 * @property {() => Issuer} getInviteIssuer
 * Zoe has a single `inviteIssuer` for the entirety of its lifetime.
 * By having a reference to Zoe, a user can get the `inviteIssuer`
 * and thus validate any `invite` they receive from someone else. The
 * mint associated with the inviteIssuer creates the ERTP payments
 * that represent the right to interact with a smart contract in
 * particular ways.
 *
 * @property {(bundle: Bundle, moduleFormat?: string) => InstallationHandle} install
 * Create an installation by safely evaluating the code and
 * registering it with Zoe. Returns an installationHandle.

 *             terms?: object)
 *            => Promise<InviteIssuerRecord>} makeInstance
 * Zoe is long-lived. We can use Zoe to create smart contract
 * instances by specifying a particular contract installation to
 * use, as well as the `issuerKeywordRecord` and `terms` of the contract. The
 * `issuerKeywordRecord` is a record mapping string names (keywords) to issuers,
 * such as `{ Asset: simoleanIssuer}`. (Note that the keywords must
 * begin with a capital letter and must be ASCII identifiers.) Parties to the
 * contract will use the keywords to index their proposal and
 * their payments.
 *
 * Terms are the arguments to the contract,
 * such as the number of bids an auction will wait for before closing.
 * Terms are up to the discretion of the smart contract. We get back
 * an invite (an ERTP payment) to participate in the contract.
 *

 *             paymentKeywordRecord?: PaymentKeywordRecord)

 * To redeem an invite, the user normally provides a proposal (their rules for the
 * offer) as well as payments to be escrowed by Zoe.  If either the proposal or payments
 * would be empty, indicate this by omitting that argument or passing undefined, rather
 * than passing an empty record.
 *
 * The proposal has three parts: `want` and `give` are used
 * by Zoe to enforce offer safety, and `exit` is used to specify
 * the particular payout-liveness policy that Zoe can guarantee.
 * `want` and `give` are objects with keywords as keys and amounts
 * as values. `paymentKeywordRecord` is a record with keywords as keys,
 * and the values are the actual payments to be escrowed. A payment
 * is expected for every rule under `give`.

 *
 * @callback Reallocate
 * The contract can propose a reallocation of values across offers
 * by providing two parallel arrays: offerHandles and newAllocations.
 * Each element of newAllocations is an AmountKeywordRecord whose
 * amount should replace the old amount for that keyword for the
 * corresponding offer.
 *
 * The reallocation will only succeed if the reallocation 1) conserves
 * rights (the amounts specified have the same total value as the
 * current total amount), and 2) is 'offer-safe' for all parties involved.
 *
 * The reallocation is partial, meaning that it applies only to the
 * amount associated with the offerHandles that are passed in. By
 * induction, if rights conservation and offer safety hold before,
 * they will hold after a safe reallocation, even though we only
 * re-validate for the offers whose allocations will change. Since
 * rights are conserved for the change, overall rights will be unchanged,
 * and a reallocation can only effect offer safety for offers whose
 * allocations change.
 *
 * zcf.reallocate will throw an error if any of the
 * newAllocations do not have a value for all the
 * keywords in sparseKeywords. An error will also be thrown if
 * any newAllocations have keywords that are not in
 * sparseKeywords.

 * @param  {AmountKeywordRecord[]} newAllocations An

 *
 * @callback Complete
 * The contract can "complete" an offer to remove it from the
 * ongoing contract and resolve the player's payouts (either
 * winnings or refunds). Because Zoe only allows for
 * reallocations that conserve rights and are 'offer-safe', we
 * don't need to do those checks at this step and can assume
 * that the invariants hold.

 * @returns {void}
 *
 * @callback MakeInvitation
 * Make a credible Zoe invite for a particular smart contract
 * indicated by the unique `instanceHandle`. The other

 * governing contract and should include whatever information is
 * necessary for a potential buyer of the invite to know what
 * they are getting. Note: if information can be derived in
 * queries based on other information, we choose to omit it. For
 * instance, `installationHandle` can be derived from
 * `instanceHandle` and is omitted even though it is useful.

  // payouts, a promise for the outcome of joining the contract,
  // and, depending on the exit conditions, perhaps a completeObj,
  // an object with a complete method for leaving the contract on demand.
